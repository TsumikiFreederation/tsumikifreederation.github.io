<p>Network testbeds are an essential research tool that have been
      responsible for numerous advances in distributed systems and
      network measurements. However, no single testbed can satisfy the
      requirements of every research project, prompting continual
      effort to develop new testbeds. </p>

<p>Tsumiki is a set of reusable components for building network
      testbeds. These components are repurposeable and interchangeable
      in deriving new kinds of testbeds. We demonstrate that Tsumiki
      components are well-suited to implementing new, diverse, and
      useful types of testbeds. Across its deployments, Tsumiki
      components have been installed on tens of thousands of devices
      and the testbeds had been used by thousands of researchers. Our
      user-study with graduate students indicate that students with no prior
      experience with networked testbeds are able to use Tsumiki to
      create a testbed with new functionality and run an experiment in
      under an hour. </p>
