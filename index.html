<p>Network testbeds are an essential research tool that have been responsible for numerous advances in distributed systems and network measurements. However, no single testbed can satisfy the requirements of every research project, prompting continual effort to develop new testbeds. While federation allows pre-existing testbeds to share resources and credentials, building a new testbed remains a substantial task.</p>

<p>We propose a new methodology called <strong>freederation</strong> that reduces testbed construction effort. Freederation dictates how to delineate and design components to improve their ability to be freely reused, repurposed, and replaced. We used this concept in the construction of a set of components called Tsumiki. Tsumiki components have reduced the development time of four different testbeds, including a testbed that spans home wireless routers used for network measurement, a testbeds composed of Android phones, a testbed that uses Raspberry PI devices for censorship detection, and a testbed with resource sharing among social links. Across its deployments, Tsumiki components have been installed on tens of thousands of devices, with the resulting testbeds being used by thousands of researchers.</p>
